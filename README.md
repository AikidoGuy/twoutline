twoutline
=========

Taskwarrior to Outline python utility.

This is being made available sooner that I was planning because I received an email request
for another one of my utilities, tw2latex. Please be aware that both utilities are a work in progress.

    $ chmod 700 twoutline.py
    $ ./twoutline.py             # to get a list of all options

Dependencies

- python package pytz available from: http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
